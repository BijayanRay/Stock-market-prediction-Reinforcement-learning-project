<h1 align="center"><u>About this Project</u></h1>
<p align="center"><i>A python implementation of a stock market prediction tool based of Deep Q-learning algorithm. It is done for group project for Reinforcement learning course at CMI. Our group comprised of <a href="https://github.com/AnkanKar-Zargon" target="_blank">Ankan Kar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BijayanRay" target="_blank">Bijayan Ray</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ishanbaner" target="_blank">Ishan Banerjee</a>, <a href="https://github.com/theliterunner" target="_blank">Praveen Kumar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/shreyam202236" target="_blank">Shreyam Banerjee<a>.</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Right now it contains the results that have been achieved. The source code is available in src folder. And the jupyter notebook with few sample runs "run 1" and "run 2" is available at <a href="https://github.com/BijayanRay/Stock-market-prediction-Reinforcement-learning-project/blob/main/DQN_multistock_(final_presentation).ipynb" target="_blank">DQN_multistock_(final_presentation).ipynb</a>. </i></p>
